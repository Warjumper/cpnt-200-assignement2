## Summary
National is a restaurant & entertainment venue inspired by North American tastes, with games and events, extraordinary food, and select craft beers. A place filled with Calgarians who embrace being Calgarian, National is the ideal place to unwind with friends, host a private event, or soak up the sun on a patio.

Long, communal tables and ample seating make it the perfect place to meet new people, and to gather with friends for brunch, lunch, or dinner.

Our food menu is big and well-considered, and dishes pair well with our curated selection of craft beers from small North American brewers.

In addition to the food and drinks, you can settle old scores on the ping pong and foosball tables, or head downstairs to bowl a few frames at our 8-lane bowling alley.
